1. Go to **Face Recognition** tab
2. Click **"Add User"** button
3. Enter user's full name
4. Upload a clear photo (JPG/PNG)
5. Click **"Add Authorized User"**

The photo will be stored in Supabase storage and the user added to the database.

#### Option B: Different Device
1. Deploy the app or run it on another computer
2. Navigate to: `http://[your-ip]:8080/alert-receiver`
3. Configure the device IP address correctly
4. Start the alert server

#### Device Configuration:

```

#### ESP32 Code Upload:
1. Install Arduino IDE
2. Install ESP32 board package
3. Install required libraries:
   - WiFi
   - WebServer
   - LiquidCrystal_I2C
4. Open `ESP32_Security_Alert_System.ino`

   ```cpp
   const char* ssid = "YOUR_WIFI_NAME";
   const char* password = "YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD";
   ```
6. Upload to ESP32

#### ESP32 API Endpoints:
- `GET /status` - Get device status
- `POST /alert` - Receive security alerts
- `POST /test` - Test buzzer and LED

### 5. Testing the Complete System

#### Test Authorized User Detection:
1. Add users via Face Recognition tab
2. Click "‚úÖ Test Authorized" button
3. Check Alert Monitor for logged event
4. Verify low-priority alert created

#### Test Unauthorized Detection:
1. Click "üö® Test Unauthorized" button
2. Alert Receiver should show full-screen alert
3. ESP32 should trigger buzzer and LED
4. Check Alert Monitor for high-priority alert

#### Test ESP32 Integration:
1. Ensure ESP32 is connected and shows IP
2. Add ESP32 device in ESP32 Control tab
3. Test direct communication
4. Verify alerts trigger ESP32 responses

## üîß Configuration Options

### Alert Severity Levels:
