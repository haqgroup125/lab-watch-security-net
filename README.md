5. **Similarity Calculation** - Uses advanced image comparison algorithms
6. **Authorization Decision** - 65%+ similarity = Authorized, <65% = Unauthorized
7. **Instant Alerts** - Unauthorized faces trigger immediate alerts

#### Detection Status Indicators:
- **SCANNING** - System is actively looking for faces
- **AUTHORIZED** - Recognized authorized user (green indicator)
- **UNAUTHORIZED** - Unknown face detected (red indicator)
- **NO FACE DETECTED** - No face visible in camera view
